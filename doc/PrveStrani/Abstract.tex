\textbf{Abstract}

% FIXME: finish this
In this thesis I have developed software for calculating energy parameters for the hydroelectric power plant. In the first part of the thesis, I have described the theoretical fundamentals and implemented algorithms for 
creating consumption curve, hydrogram and duration curve out of given data for river channels of any geometry, as well as calculating produced electricity. In the second part of the thesis, I provided an example that proves correctness of the software calculations.
