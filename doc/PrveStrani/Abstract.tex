\textbf{Abstract}

% FIXME: finish this
%In this thesis I have developed software for calculating energy parameters for the hydroelectric power plant. In the first part of the thesis, I have described the theoretical fundamentals and implemented algorithms for 
%creating consumption curve, hydrogram and duration curve out of given data for river channels of any geometry, as well as calculating produced electricity. In the second part of the thesis, I provided an example that proves correctness of the software calculations.


In this thesis I have developed software for calculation of energy parameters of hydroelectric power plants. In the first part, the thesis provides an overview of the theoretical fundamentals. On this basis, the numerical algorithm was developed and implemented, which allows the estimation of the consumption curve, hydrograph, duration curve and the produced electricity for river channel of any geometry. Finally, the accuracy of the software calculations was verified with an example, calculated manually.
