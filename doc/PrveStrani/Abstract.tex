\textbf{Abstract}

% FIXME: finish this
In this thesis I have developed software for calculation of energy parameters for the hydroelectric power plant. In the first part of the thesis, I have described the theoretical fundamentals and implemented algorithms for calculating consumption curve, duration curve and electricty production for river channels of any geometry. In the second part of the thesis, I provided an example that proves correctness of the software calculations.
